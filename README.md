# Bilevel Optimization in PYthon (PSOPY)

This repository includes Python codes to solve linear bilevel problems.

## Installation

```python
git clone https://github.com/salvapineda/bilpy.git

cd bilpy
```

## Fortuny-Amat approach

Complementarity conditions are replaced by a set of linear inequalities according to Fortuny-Amat method [1,4]

```python
  # Import blp class
  from bilpy import blp

  # Generate a random linear bilevel problem with nvar variables and ncon constraints. Further info: help(blp)
  blp1 = blp(nvar=50,ncon=25)

  # Solve the bilevel problem using the Fortuny-Amat approah setting all bigM to 1000. Further info: help(blp.solve_mip)
  of,time = blp1.solve_mip(M=1000, lpsolver = 'cplex', mipsolver='cplex')
```

## Regularization approach

Complementarity conditions are regularized according to Scholtes approach [2,3,4]

```python
  # Import blp class
  from bilpy import blp

  # Generate a random linear bilevel problem with nvar variables and ncon constraints. Further info: help(blp)
  blp1 = blp(nvar=50,ncon=25)

  # Solve the bilevel problem using the Fortuny-Amat approah setting using the following values of the regularization parameter [10**6,10**4,10**2,1,0.1,0.01,0]. Further info: help(blp.solve_reg)
  of,time = blp1.solve_reg(vector_ep = [10**6,10**4,10**2,1,0.1,0.01,0], lpsolver='cplex', nlpsolver='ipopt')
```
